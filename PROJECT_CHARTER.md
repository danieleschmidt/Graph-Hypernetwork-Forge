# Project Charter: Graph Hypernetwork Forge

## Project Overview

**Project Name**: Graph Hypernetwork Forge  
**Project Type**: Open Source ML Research Framework  
**Start Date**: 2025-01-01  
**Status**: Active Development  
**Current Version**: 0.1.0  

## Problem Statement

Traditional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) require retraining when applied to new knowledge graphs with different schemas or domains. This creates significant barriers for zero-shot transfer learning and cross-domain applications in knowledge graph reasoning tasks.

## Solution Vision

Graph Hypernetwork Forge provides a hypernetwork-based approach that generates GNN weights dynamically from textual node descriptions, enabling zero-shot reasoning on previously unseen knowledge graphs without retraining.

## Project Scope

### In Scope
- Dynamic GNN weight generation from text descriptions
- Zero-shot transfer learning capabilities
- Modular architecture supporting multiple GNN backends (GCN, GAT, GraphSAGE)
- Comprehensive benchmark evaluation framework
- Production-ready containerized deployment
- Extensive documentation and tutorials

### Out of Scope
- Traditional static GNN implementations
- Non-textual node metadata processing (images, audio)
- Real-time streaming graph updates
- Graph database integration (initial release)

## Success Criteria

### Technical Objectives
- **Performance**: 25%+ improvement over traditional GNNs on HyperGNN-X benchmark
- **Zero-Shot Capability**: Successfully transfer to unseen KG domains without retraining
