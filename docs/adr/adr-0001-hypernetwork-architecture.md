# ADR-0001: Hypernetwork Architecture Choice

**Date**: 2025-08-01  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Deciders**: Daniel Schmidt, Core Development Team  

## Context and Problem Statement

Traditional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) require complete retraining when applied to new knowledge graphs with different schemas or domains. This creates significant barriers for zero-shot transfer learning and limits the practical applicability of GNNs in dynamic, multi-domain environments.

We need to design an architecture that can dynamically adapt GNN weights based on textual node descriptions without requiring retraining on new graphs.

## Decision Drivers

- **Zero-Shot Transfer**: Enable application to unseen knowledge graphs without retraining
- **Modularity**: Support multiple GNN architectures (GCN, GAT, GraphSAGE)
- **Efficiency**: Maintain reasonable computational overhead for weight generation
- **Flexibility**: Allow for different text encoders and hypernetwork configurations
- **Research Impact**: Advance state-of-the-art in neural architecture search and meta-learning

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Meta-Learning Approach (MAML)
- Use Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning to adapt GNN weights through gradient steps
- **Pros**: Theoretically grounded, proven in few-shot learning
- **Cons**: Requires support set, multiple gradient steps, high computational cost

### Option 2: Parameter Prediction Networks
- Train a network to predict optimal GNN parameters directly from graph statistics
- **Pros**: Fast inference, graph-level adaptation
- **Cons**: Limited to graph-level features, no node-level textual information

### Option 3: Hypernetwork Architecture (Chosen)
- Use hypernetworks to generate GNN weights from textual node embeddings
- **Pros**: Node-level adaptation, fast inference, flexible text integration
- **Cons**: Complex architecture, potential training instability

### Option 4: Adaptive Layers with Attention
- Add attention mechanisms to existing GNN layers that adapt based on text
- **Pros**: Simple integration, interpretable attention weights
- **Cons**: Limited adaptation capability, architecture-specific

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option**: Hypernetwork Architecture (Option 3)

**Rationale**: Hypernetworks provide the optimal balance of flexibility, efficiency, and zero-shot capability. They can generate weights dynamically from textual node descriptions, enabling true zero-shot transfer to unseen graphs while maintaining reasonable computational overhead.

### Positive Consequences
- **Dynamic Adaptation**: Weights generated on-the-fly from text descriptions
- **Zero-Shot Capability**: No retraining required for new domains
- **Modular Design**: Supports different GNN backends and text encoders
- **Research Novelty**: Novel application of hypernetworks to graph neural networks
- **Scalability**: Linear complexity in number of nodes for weight generation

### Negative Consequences
- **Training Complexity**: Hypernetworks can be unstable during training
- **Memory Overhead**: Additional parameters for the hypernetwork component
- **Architecture Complexity**: More complex than traditional GNNs
- **Limited Precedent**: Fewer established best practices for hypernetwork training

## Implementation Notes

### Core Architecture
```python
text_descriptions → TextEncoder → text_embeddings
text_embeddings → Hypernetwork → gnn_weights  
(node_features, edge_index, gnn_weights) → DynamicGNN → predictions
```

### Key Components
1. **Text Encoder**: Sentence Transformers/BERT for semantic embeddings
2. **Hypernetwork**: Multi-layer perceptron with residual connections
3. **Dynamic GNN**: Applies generated weights to graph convolutions
4. **Weight Generator**: Maps text embeddings to weight tensors

### Technical Specifications
- **Input**: Text descriptions per node (variable length)
- **Text Embedding Dimension**: 384-768 (encoder dependent)
- **Weight Generation**: Per-layer weight matrices for GNN
- **Supported GNNs**: GCN, GAT, GraphSAGE (extensible)

### Training Strategy
- **Stage 1**: Pre-train text encoder on large text corpus
- **Stage 2**: Joint training of hypernetwork and GNN on diverse graphs
- **Stage 3**: Fine-tuning on domain-specific datasets

## Validation and Testing

### Performance Benchmarks
- Microsoft HyperGNN-X benchmark suite
- Cross-domain transfer evaluation
- Scalability testing on large graphs (100K+ nodes)

### Success Criteria
- 25%+ improvement over traditional GNNs on benchmark tasks
- Successful zero-shot transfer to completely unseen domains
- Sub-100ms inference time for medium-sized graphs

## Alternatives Considered and Rejected

### Graph Meta Networks
- **Rejected**: Limited to graph-level features, no textual integration
- **Reason**: Doesn't leverage rich textual node descriptions

### Contextual Parameter Networks
- **Rejected**: Requires structural similarity between graphs
- **Reason**: Doesn't support true zero-shot transfer to different domains

### Multi-Task Learning
- **Rejected**: Still requires training data from target domains
- **Reason**: Doesn't achieve zero-shot capability
